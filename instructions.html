        <h3><strong>Find Words That Match:</strong></h3>
        <p>
            You will see many words on the screen, arranged in a square.<br>
            Your job is to find 4 words that are similar or belong together.<br>
            Think about what the words mean. How are some of them connected?
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Select Words:</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Click on a word to select it. It will look different when it's selected.<br>
            Find and click on 3 more words that are connected to the first word.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Submit Your Answer:</strong></h3>
        <p>
            After selecting 4 words that go together, look for a "Submit" button.<br>
            Click the "Submit" button to see if you are right.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Keep Going:</strong></h3>
        <p>
            If you were right, those words will group together.<br>
            Now, find more groups of words that match.<br>
            Keep doing this until you have grouped all the words.<br>
        </p>

        <h3><strong>You Get Four Tries:</strong></h3>
        <p>
            You can try to group words together up to 4 times.<br>
            If you make a mistake, it's okay. Try again!<br>
            If you use all 4 tries, you have to wait until the next day to play again.
